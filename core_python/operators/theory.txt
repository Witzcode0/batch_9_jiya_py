Operators are special symbols or keywords that perform operations on values and variables (called operands). They are fundamental for manipulating data, performing calculations, making comparisons, and controlling program flow. 

res = a + b;
res, a, b - operands
=, + - operators
and, or, not

Python has seven primary categories of operators: 
    Arithmetic Operators: Perform mathematical calculations.
    +, -, *, /, //, **, %

    Assignment Operators: Assign values to variables.
    =, =+, =-, =*, =/, =//, =**, =%

    Comparison (Relational) Operators: Compare two values and return a Boolean result (True or False).
    ==, !=, <, <= >, >=

    Logical Operators: Combine multiple conditional statements using Boolean logic (and, or, not).
    and, or, not

    Bitwise Operators: Perform operations directly on the binary representation (bits) of integers.
    &, |, ^, ~, <<, >>

    Identity Operators: Check if two variables refer to the exact same object in memory using is and is not.
    is, is not

    Membership Operators: Test whether a value exists within a sequence (like a list, string, or tuple) using in and not in. 
    in, not in
